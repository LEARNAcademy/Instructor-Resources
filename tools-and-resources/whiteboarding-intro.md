# Introduction to White Boarding

### Technical Interviews

One of the unique parts about becoming a developer is that interviewing for the job looks very different that most other industries. This is because being a developer is just perpetually solving code problems.

### What is White Boarding?

The questions is, how can an interviewer tell if you are going to be good at the job of solving code problems?
There are lots of ways this can happen during an interview: asking technical questions, having you pair with a developer from the team, giving you a take home test, or they can ask you to white board. Traditionally, white boarding is literally handing you a dry erase marker asking you to code. In a virtual setting it is giving you a blank screen and asking you to code. This can be pretty intimidating when you are already nervous about an interview. So we want to give you lots of practice here in a safe and friendly environment.

### Why White Boarding?

To be fair, white boarding is not always the best way to assess a candidates technical strengths. It just isn't how you code. No one codes without Google or without notes. Developers don't memorize things. But it is one tactic that is used and it gets at the fundamental principles of interviewing.

The main thing is that a tech lead wants to know what you do when you don't know how to solve a problem. When evaluating your technical skills, quizzing you on what you know isn't always the best use of time. The journey to becoming a developer is the process of getting really, really comfortable NOT knowing the answer. So, while your interviewer wants to know where you are at technically, they also really want to know what you do when you don't know something. Your interviewer wants to see how you think and reason under pressure.

### How Does This Go?

We are going to do virtual white boarding exercises every week. We will ask you a generic interview question, a couple technical questions, and give you a coding challenge prompt. You will code out the challenge in a text or markdown file.

White boarding is NOT about the code.

White boarding is about communication.
Shifting your focus from trying to write perfect code with perfect logic to trying to show your process.

This is also your opportunity to see if the company is going to be a good fit for you. Remember that during an interview, you are interviewing them as much as much they are interviewing you.

### How Can You Be Successful?

Interact with the interviewer. Ask questions. Pseudo code! Pseudo test! Walk through the problem in English and check in with the interviewer. Establish an input and output. If you don't know how to solve a problem, solve a simpler version of that problem. Focus on concepts over syntax.

The process is:

- Write down the prompt
- Ask questions and confirm the prompt
- Establish an input and output - write them down
- It is not about the code, it is about the process
- If you are really lost, solve a simpler version of the problem

### Mock Interview

The instruction team will perform a mock interview.

Question: How do you learn best?

Prompt: Create a function that takes a string of multiple words. If the individual word is five or more letters, reverse the word. If it is less than five letters leave it as is.

- Ask questions to confirm understanding
- Input: "hey there learn"
- Output: "hey ereht nrael"
- Pseudo code
- Create a function
- Parameter - string
- Access to each word - split on the space ["hey", "there", "bravo"]
- Make a decision about each item - iterate with map
- If length is less than 5 return as is
- If longer reverse - split, reverse, join
- Join the result of map

### Summary

White boarding is about communication not about code. Write things down and don't make assumptions. Establish and WRITE DOWN an input and an output. This will help me as the interviewer know you understood what I am asking you to do. It also will help you keep focused on your goal.
Ask questions and talk through your problem. Keep your interviewer engaged.

We are going to practice technical interviews every Thursday for the next few weeks. During these sessions you will go with one of the instructors to a breakout room. Each week we will interview 2 students. If you are not being interviewed on a given week, you should still be participating by trying to answer the questions on your own. You should take each question as an opportunity to practice.
