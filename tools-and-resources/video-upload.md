### Recording Videos in Zoom
The goal is to record all lectures for LEARN's internal use and student's reference. To record a video an instructor must be host or cohost of the Zoom meeting.
- Click `Record` in the Zoom UI
- Select `Record to Computer`
- Recordings can be paused during breaks
- End recording at the conclusion of the lecture
- Zoom will process the video and add the files to a Zoom folder located in your computer's Documents folder

### Upload to YouTube
- Create > Upload videos
- Drag and drop the `mp4` file to the YouTube UI
- Name the video with the following convention:
  - year - cohort-initial - topic
  - Ex: `2022 - a - JavaScript Arrays`
  - Ex: `2022 - a - Pair Programming with Adam Cuppy`
- If a lecture is broken into two or more videos, the different parts can be donated:
  - Ex: `2022 - a - JavaScript Objects Part I`
  - Ex: `2022 - a - JavaScript Objects Part II`
- Select the appropriate cohort playlist
- Ensure video is `unlisted`
- Ensure video is `Not made for children`

### Posting Video
- Each cohort should have a Google doc in the LEARNers Drive with all the video links
- The links are listed with the most recent one first
- Include the date, the topic, and the link to the video
  - Ex: `2/16 JavaScript Arrays https://youtu.be/K3dieBfOdV0`
  - Ex: `2/25 Pair Programming with Adam Cuppy https://youtu.be/3wMWMX8SmTo`
- Ensure the topic in the doc matches the topic on the Google doc
